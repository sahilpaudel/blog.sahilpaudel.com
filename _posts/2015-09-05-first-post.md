It has been more than a month being at Bangalore, all the way from Punjab.
It's bit crowded. The traffic is unbearable but I liked the climate here, it shows resemblance with my hometown's climate to some extend.

As a guy who likes to travel it's a perfect base to visit all South-Indian destination spots.
For now I have to complete Karnataka first, it would be first travel blog post.

Few of notable place I have visited:

### Cubbon Park
It is away from noisy town(no that far but great to hang out), those greeen tall standing trees and bamboos gives a perfect site you might want to be after long and tiring weekdays. There were also some fun activity park inside viz. **Break Dance**,**Ferris Wheel**, **Pirate Ship** but unfortunately **Boat** ride was closed but overall it is a good destination to hangout with friends.

### Jawaharlal Nehru Planeterium
Oh! this one was interesting, it was great experience getting insights and facts about stars and other stuffs up there and none other than _Galileo_ was giving the insight. All those visual effects were awesome, it is a must go place when you are in **Bangalore**.

### HAL Aerospace Museum
Great place for _aerospace_ and _fighter plane_ fans, indeed it was amazing to see all fighter planes, helicopter that has been use at various stage of National duty. Going through the archives, who  was constructed? who were the architects? who bought such masterpiece to the country? Those hangeed pictures will make go wow. Another must visit place.

### LalBagh Botanical Garden
Another peaceful site, away from noisy town with bunch of green tree, pines, well maintained gardens, collections of flowers and lake with **Lotus**. It is good place where you come with someone you want to talk and relax on a fine evening.
