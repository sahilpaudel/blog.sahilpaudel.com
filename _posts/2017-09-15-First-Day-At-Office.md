Monday, 21st August'17

As we all the freshers were celebrating on completion of weeks of boring training sessions. There enters horde of leads and managers all with a thomping sounds that was synchronizing with my heart beat.
All lined up in front of us, almost it looks like they gonna auction us into different teams. Guys praying for a beautiful girl in the team, girls holding hand of their besties with the hope that they get same team.
But that did happened and auction was over. We got our respective team.
We had small welcome meeting with cake cutting, oh! no no cake wasn't for welcome it was our leads birthday.
Then we dispersed.
